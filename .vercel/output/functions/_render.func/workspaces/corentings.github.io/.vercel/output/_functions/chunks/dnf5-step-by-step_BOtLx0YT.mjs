Although it is still in development and won't be the default package manager until Fedora 39, you can install it now and start using it.\nThis blog post will show you how to replace DNF with DNF5 on your Fedora system.\n\n<br />\n\n## What's the difference between dnf5 and dnf ?\n\nDNF is an old, single-threaded package manager with much legacy code. It's written in Python and is usually described as slow by users. <br />DNF5, on the other hand, is a complete rewrite of DNF written in C++. It's multi-threaded, has a better user experience, should be easier to maintain, and is faster.\n\n<br />\n\n## Why should I upgrade to dnf5?\n\nUpgrading to DNF5 offers several benefits, including improved speed and efficiency.\nDNF5 is designed to be faster and more efficient than DNF, which can help speed up your system's package installation and update process. <br />Additionally, as it will be the default package manager in <a href={'https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf5/issues/411'} class=\"font-bold underline text-accent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fedora\n39</a>, starting to use it now and reporting any bugs you encounter will help the developers fix them before the release.\n\n<br />\n\n## How to upgrade to dnf5?\n\n### **Step 1: Install dnf5**\n\nTo install DNF5 from the unstable repository, run the following command:\n\n```bash\ndnf copr enable rpmsoftwaremanagement/dnf5-unstable ;\ndnf install dnf5 dnf5-plugins\n```\n\n<br />\n\nIf you're using sudo, use this command instead:\n\n```bash\nsudo dnf copr enable rpmsoftwaremanagement/dnf5-unstable ;\nsudo dnf install dnf5 dnf5-plugins\n```\n\n<br />\n\n### **Step 2: Create an alias for dnf5 (optional)**\n\nYou can create an alias if you want to use DNF5 instead of DNF. Run the following command:\n\n```bash\nalias dnf=\"dnf5\"\n```\n\n<br />\n\nTo make this alias permanent, add it to your `~/.bashrc` file:\n\n```bash\necho \"alias dnf=\\\"dnf5\\\"\" >> ~/.bashrc\n```\n\n<br />\n\nOr add it to your `~/.zshrc` file if you use zsh:\n\n```bash\necho \"alias dnf=\\\"dnf5\\\"\" >> ~/.zshrc\n```\n\n<br />\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nRemember that DNF5 is still in development and not ready for production use. It may contain bugs and should not be used on production systems. Use it at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage caused by using DNF5.\n\n<br />\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDNF5 may still have some bugs, so it's essential to experiment with it and keep this blog post up-to-date with the latest changes.\nThis guide helped you upgrade to DNF5.
