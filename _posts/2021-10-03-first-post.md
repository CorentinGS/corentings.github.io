## 1. Get started

Some time ago I thought I should create a **portfolio** and a **personal blog** to share my projects and thoughts!
I'm not a big fan of social networks so I wanted to create it using **open-source tools** and host it on github.

## 2. Tools

In order to create this personal website, I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [portfolyou](https://github.com/YoussefRaafatNasry/portfolYOU) theme.
