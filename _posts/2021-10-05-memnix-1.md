# Devlogs 1

## 1. Database

So I've started to think about memnix's database ! I've created tables to handle cards & decks.
{% include elements/figure.html image="./assets/memnix-db1.png" caption="VStudio Schema" %}

It's not much but still a great start !

## 2. Rest API

I've been working on a rest API using Gofiber & Gorm (golang) to access my Database.
It's not fully ready yet but I want to start documenting before coding more & as I'm going to edit my database soon, I prefer to wait a bit more. Otherwise, it's ready for testing purpose !

## 3. What's next

The next goal is to start writting a documentation for my api !
Then, I'll need to keep working on my database and to start designing memnix's engine !

I'm also thinking about a discord bot to beta test my api and to start collecting data about users.
