## Introduction

My recent trip to Armenia wasn't just a vacationâ€”it was a chess pilgrimage! 
I participated in the prestigious Karen Asrian Memorial, a chess tournament that pushed me to my limits and left me with unforgettable memories.

## The Tournament

The Karen Asrian Memorial is a tournament dedicated to a chess legend. 
GM Avetik Grigoryan wrote a fantastic article about him, which I highly advise you to read:

One of the tournament's highlights was meeting Levon Aronian, a true chess superstar. I was fortunate to meet such a player in person.

The tournament format consisted of nine rounds spread over nine days. Each game was a marathon, lasting between 3 and 4.5 hours.

## My performance

Overall, this was my most robust performance yet. 
I beat a player rated over 2150 and even faced a Grandmaster in a classical chess game for the first time.
While I achieved a dominant position, time pressure ultimately led to a bittersweet loss. 

At the beginning of the tournament, I was rated 1803 Elo and was the 67th player over 73 according to the initial ranking. 
I finished with 3.5 points over 9, half a point more than my initial goal. I earned 34 fide elo points and a performance of 2000 elo! 
My final rank is 57th, meaning I had an excellent performance.

## Chessmood

Speaking of improvement, a big part of my chess journey wouldn't have been possible without the Chessmood team. T
heir training platform helped me climb over 300 points in online blitz and rapid chess ratings. 
This translated into real-world results, allowing me to consistently defeat players rated around 2000 Elo.
I also had the opportunity to meet them in person. I played in the tournament with IM David Shahinyan, who helped me improve recently. 
Furthermore, I could visit Chessmood's office, discover their waiting room, and have a great barbecue with them!
