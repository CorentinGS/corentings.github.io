## Parallel Merge Sort vs Simple Merge Sort

This is a simple example of how to use goroutines to **parallelize** a merge sort algorithm.
We compare the performance of a simple merge sort algorithm with a parallel merge sort algorithm that uses goroutines.

## The Merge Sort Algorithm

The merge sort algorithm is a divide and conquer algorithm that recursively splits the input array into two halves,
sorts each half, and then merges the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.

{" "}

<br></br>

To speed up the merge sort algorithm, we use insertion sort for small subarrays (less than 12 elements).

{" "}

<br></br>

The implementation of the algorithm uses generics to allow sorting of any type of numbers.

```go
func MergeSort[T Number](items []T) []T {
	size := len(items)
	if size < 2 {
		return items
	}

	if size < K {
		return Insertionsort(items)
	}

	middle := size / 2
	var a = MergeSort(items[:middle])
	var b = MergeSort(items[middle:])

	return merge(a, b)
}
```

{" "}

<br></br>

## The Merge Sort Algorithm with Goroutines

The parallel merge sort algorithm uses **goroutines** to sort the two halves of the input array in parallel.

To prevent the creation of too many goroutines, we use a **threshold** to determine when to use goroutines.
If the size of the input array is less than the threshold,
we use a simple merge sort algorithm instead of a parallel one.

{" "}

<br></br>

Here we use a threshold of 512 elements. We can benchmark the performance of the algorithm with
different thresholds to find the optimal threshold, but we will not do that in this example.

```go
// ParallelMerge Perform merge sort on a slice using goroutines
func ParallelMerge[T Number](items []T) []T {
	if len(items) < 2 {
		return items
	}

	// Use a simple merge sort algorithm if the size of the input array is less than the threshold
	if len(items) < 512 {
		return MergeSort(items)
	}

	// Create the wait group to wait for the goroutines to finish
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(1)

	var middle = len(items) / 2  // Find the middle index of the input array
	var a []T                   // Create a slice to hold the first half of the input array
	go func() {                // Create a goroutine to sort the first half of the input array
		defer wg.Done()       // Decrement the wait group counter when the goroutine finishes
		a = ParallelMerge(items[:middle]) // Sort the first half of the input array
	}()
	var b = ParallelMerge(items[middle:]) // Sort the second half of the input array

	wg.Wait() // Wait for the goroutine to finish
	return merge(a, b) // Merge the two sorted halves
}
```

{" "}

<br></br>

## Benchmarking the Merge Sort Algorithms

Now we can benchmark our merge sort algorithms to compare their **performance**.

To benchmark the algorithms, we use arrays of different sizes and **measure the time** it takes to sort the arrays.

{" "}

<br></br>

To run the benchmark we use the following command:

```bash
go test -bench=. -benchtime 5s > benchmark.txt && benchstat benchmark.txt
```

{" "}

<br></br>

Benchstat is a tool that can be used to compare the results of benchmarks.

The results of the benchmark are as follows:

```bash
name                                   time/op
Mergesort/1000                     14.6µs ± 0%
Mergesort/10000                     473µs ± 0%
Mergesort/100000                   6.33ms ± 0%
Mergesort/1000000                  87.4ms ± 0%

MergesortWithGoroutines/1000       18.7µs ± 0%
MergesortWithGoroutines/10000       217µs ± 0%
MergesortWithGoroutines/100000     2.71ms ± 0%
MergesortWithGoroutines/1000000    29.0ms ± 0%
```

{" "}

<br></br>

As we can see, the parallel merge sort algorithm is **much faster** than the simple merge sort algorithm for **large arrays**.

{" "}

<br></br>

## Why is the Parallel Merge Sort Algorithm Faster?

The parallel merge sort algorithm is faster because it uses goroutines to sort the two halves of the input array in **parallel**.
The simple merge sort algorithm sorts the two halves of the input array **sequentially**.

{" "}

<br></br>

As discussed in the previous article, the cost of **creating a goroutine can be high**.
So we should use a parallel merge sort algorithm only when the size of the input array is **large enough to justify the cost** of creating goroutines.

{" "}

<br></br>

## Conclusion

In this example, we have seen how to use **goroutines to parallelize** a merge sort algorithm. We have also benchmarked the performance of the merge sort algorithms to compare their performance.
Goroutines are a **powerful tool** that should be used **only when the cost of creating goroutines is justified** by the performance improvement.

In this example, the code isn't more complex when using goroutines therefore it's worth using them.
