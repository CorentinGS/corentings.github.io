        Hey, my name is Corentin and I'm 20 years old.<br /><br />

        Currently, I'm studying for a BSC. Computer Science at the <a

        I'm also a freelance backend developer and I've been working on several
        projects for the past year including website and web applications. My
        main programming language is <a

        > but I've also worked with java, python, typescript, C/C++ and more.<br
        /> I also have experience with databases such as PostgreSQL or MongoDB and
        I'm familiar with Docker, Docker Compose and even Podman.

        Furthermore, I'm a passionate open-source enthusiast and have been
        contributing to several projects for a few years now. I've also created <a

        <br /><br />

        I like to manage communities and I'm currently the founder of <a
          href="/discord"
          target="_blank"

        You might also meet me on a chess board as I'm playing a lot and I'm managing
        a chess community for my friend <a

        I'm also a big fan of Linux and I've been using it since my youngest
        age. At the moment, I'm using <a
